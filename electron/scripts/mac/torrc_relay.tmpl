## Rapid Bootstrap Testing Options ##
# These typically launch a working minimal Tor network in ~20s
# These parameters make tor networks bootstrap fast,
# but can cause consensus instability and network unreliability
# (Some are also bad for security.)
#
# We need at least 3 descriptors to build circuits.
# In a 3 relay network, 0.67 > 2/3, so we try hard to get 3 descriptors.
# In larger networks, 0.67 > 2/N, so we try hard to get >=3 descriptors.

# This file is named "relay.tmpl" for compatibility with previous
# chutney versions

# An exit relay that can exit to IPv4 localhost
# (newer versions of tor need this to be explicitly configured)


# 1. Allow exiting to IPv4 localhost and private networks by default
# -------------------------------------------------------------

# Each IPv4 tor instance is configured with Address 127.0.0.1 by default
# ExitPolicy accept 127.0.0.0/8:*

# If you only want tor to connect to localhost, disable these lines:
# This may cause network failures in some circumstances
# ExitPolicyRejectPrivate 0
# ExitPolicy accept private:*

# 2. Optionally: Allow exiting to the entire IPv4 internet on HTTP(S)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. or 3. are required to work around #11264 with microdescriptors enabled
# "The core of this issue appears to be that the Exit flag code is
#  optimistic (just needs a /8 and 2 ports), but the microdescriptor
#  exit policy summary code is pessimistic (needs the entire internet)."
# An alternative is to disable microdescriptors and use regular
# descriptors, as they do not suffer from this issue.
ExitPolicy accept *:80
ExitPolicy accept *:443

# 3. Optionally: Accept all IPv4 addresses, that is, the public internet
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
ExitPolicy accept *:*

# 4. Finally, reject all IPv4 addresses which haven't been permitted
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# ExitPolicy reject *:*

# This allows unlimited bandwidth rate.
